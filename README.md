## Introduction
This is a lightweight API Gateway written in Go, supporting route registration, request proxying, rate limiting, and JWT-based authentication. Itâ€™s a toy project built to explore the fundamentals of API gateway design. The gateway is configured through a `config.yaml` file, loaded on startup, which defines key settings such as the listening port, registered routes with their corresponding endpoints, request rate limits, etc.
